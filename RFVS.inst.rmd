You must match the machine architecture: run 32-bit R if you have 32-bit FVS and 64-bit R if you have built FVS as 64-bit.  32 bit seems to be the reccomended combination.  Change between 32 nd 64 bit through tools->global options->rversion.

Download the rFVS file here (21 files total): https://sourceforge.net/p/open-fvs/code/HEAD/tree/rFVS/

The first step is to start R and load the rFVS functions found in <open-fvs>/rFVS/R. Remember to replace the string <open-fvs> with the pathname of where you have stored your copy of (r?)FVS. The notation <open-fvs>/ defines the directory where the open-fvs code is stored on your system. Modify this string so that the path name to the files can be found (remember to change \ to /).
```{r}
sdir = "<C:/rFVS>/R"


for (rf in dir (sdir)) source (paste(sdir,rf,sep="/"))


# load the FVS library
fvsLoad("FVSiec")

# specify the keyword file
fvsSetCmdLine("--keywordfile=iet01.key")

# Run the simulation as would be done using FVS as a program
fvsRun()
```
